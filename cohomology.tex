\section{Group Cohomology}
\subsection{Group Rings}
Let $G$ be a finite group.  The group ring $\Z[G]$ of $G$ is the free
abelian group on the elements of $G$ equipped with 
multiplication given by the group structure on~$G$.  Note that $\Z[G]$
is a commutative ring if and only if~$G$ is commutative.  

For example, the
group ring of the cyclic group $C_n=\langle a\rangle$ of order~$n$ is
the free $\Z$-module on $1,a,\ldots, a^{n-1}$, and the multiplication
is induced by $a^i a^j = a^{i+j} = a^{i + j \pmod{n}}$ extended linearly.
For example, in  $\Z[C_3]$ we have
$$
  (1 + 2 a)(1 - a^2) = 1 - a^2 + 2a - 2 a^3 = 1 + 2a - a^2 - 2 = -1 + 2a - a^2.
$$
You might think that $\Z[C_3]$ is isomorphic to the ring $\Z[\zeta_3]$
of integers of $\Q(\zeta_3)$, but you would be wrong, since the ring
of integers is isomorphic to $\Z^2$ as abelian group, but $\Z[C_3]$
is isomorphic to $\Z^3$ as abelian group.  (Note that $\Q(\zeta_3)$
is a quadratic extension of~$\Q$.)

\section{Modules and Group Cohomology}
Let~$A$ be a~$G$ module.  This means that $A$ is an abelian group
equipped with a left action of~$G$, i.e., a group homomorphism $G\to
\Aut(A)$, where $\Aut(A)$ denotes the group of bijections $A\to A$
that preserve the group structure on $A$.  Alternatively,~$A$ is a
module over the ring $\Z[G]$ in the usual sense of module.  For
example, $\Z$ with the trivial action is a module over any group~$G$,
as is $\Z/m\Z$ for any positive integer~$m$.  Another example
is $G=(\Z/n\Z)^*$, which acts via multiplication on $\Z/n\Z$.

For each integer $n\geq 0$ there is an abelian group $\H^n(G,A)$
called the {\em $n$th cohomology group of~$G$ acting on~$A$}.  The
general definition is somewhat complicated, but the definition for
$n\leq 1$ is fairly concrete.
For example, the {\em $0$th cohomology group}
$$
  \H^0(G,A) = \{x \in A : \sigma x = x \text{ for all } \sigma \in G\} = G^A
$$
is the subgroup of elements of $A$ that are fixed by every element
of~$G$.  

The {\em first cohomology group}
$$
\H^1(G,A) = C^1(G,A)/B^1(G,A)
$$
is the group of $1$-cocycles modulo $1$-coboundaries, where
$$
  C^1(G, A) = \{f : G \to A \text{ such that } f(\sigma\tau) = f(\sigma) + \sigma f(\tau)\}
$$
and if we let $f_a: G \to A$ denote the set-theoretic map $f_a(\sigma) = \sigma(a)-a$,
then
$$ 
  B^1(G, A) = \{f_a :  a\in A\}.
$$
There are also explicit, and increasingly complicated, definitions of
$\H^n(G,A)$ for each $n\geq 2$ in terms of certain maps $G \times
\cdots \times G \to A$ modulo a subgroup, but we will not need this.

For example, if $A$ has the trivial action, then $B^1(G,A)=0$, since
$\sigma a - a = a -a =0$ for any $a\in A$.  Also, $C^1(G,A) =
\Hom(G,A)$.  If $A=\Z$, then since $G$ is finite there are no nonzero
homomorphisms $G\to \Z$, so $\H^1(G,\Z)=0$.  

If $X$ is any abelian group, then
$$
  A = \Hom(\Z[G], X)
$$
is a $G$-module.  We call a module constructed in this way
{\em co-induced}.    

The following theorem gives three properties of group cohomology,
which uniquely determine group cohomology.  
\begin{theorem}
Suppose $G$ is a finite group.  Then
\begin{enumerate}
\item We have $\H^0(G,A) = A^G$.
\item If $A$ is a co-induced $G$-module, then $\H^n(G,A) = 0$ for all $n\geq 1$.
\item If $0\to A \to B \to C \to 0$ is any exact sequence of 
$G$-modules, then there is a long exact sequence
$$
 0 \to \H^0(G,A) \to \H^0(G,B) \to \H^0(G,C) \to \H^1(G,A) \to \cdots
$$
$$
   \cdots \to \H^{n}(G,A) \to \H^{n}(G,B) \to \H^{n}(G,C) \to \H^{n+1}(G,A) \to \cdots
$$
\end{enumerate}
Moreover, the functor $\H^n(G,-)$ is uniquely determined by
these three properties. 
\end{theorem}
We will not prove this theorem.  For proofs see
\cite[Atiyah-Wall]{cassels-frohlich} and
\cite[Ch.~7]{serre:localfields}. The properties of the theorem
uniquely determine group cohomology, so one should in theory be able
to use them to deduce anything that can be deduced about cohomology
groups.  Indeed, in practice one frequently proves results about
higher cohomology groups $\H^n(G,A)$ by writing down appropriate exact
sequences, using explicit knowledge of $\H^0$, and chasing diagrams.

\begin{remark}
  Alternatively, we could view the defining properties of the theorem
  as the definition of group cohomology, and could state a theorem
  that asserts that group cohomology exists.
\end{remark}

\begin{remark}
  For those familiar with commutative and homological algebra, we have
$$
  \H^n(G,A) = \Ext^n_{\Z[G]}(\Z, A),
$$
where $\Z$ is the trivial $G$-module.
\end{remark}

\begin{remark}
  One can interpret $\H^2(G,A)$ as the group of equivalence classes of
  extensions of $G$ by $A$, where an extension is an exact sequence
  $$0\to A \to M \to G \to 1$$ such that the induced conjugation action
  of $G$ on $A$ is the given action of~$G$ on~$A$.
(Note that $G$ acts by conjugation, as $A$ is a normal
subgroup since it is the kernel of a homomorphism.)
\end{remark}


\subsection{Example Application of the Theorem}
For example, let's see what we get from the exact sequence
$$
 0 \to \Z \xrightarrow{m} \Z \to \Z/m\Z \to 0,
$$
where $m$ is a positive integer, and $\Z$ has the structure of 
trivial~$G$ module.  By definition we have
$\H^0(G,\Z) = \Z$ and $\H^0(G,\Z/m\Z)=\Z/m\Z$.
The long exact sequence begins
$$
  0 \to \Z \xra{m} \Z \to \Z/m\Z \to \H^1(G,\Z) \xra{m} 
\H^1(G,\Z) \to \H^1(G,\Z/m\Z)\to
\H^2(G,\Z) \xra{m} \H^2(G,\Z) \to \cdots
$$
From the first few terms of the sequence and the fact
that $\Z$ surjects onto $\Z/m\Z$, we see that $[m]$ 
on $\H^1(G,\Z)$ is injective.
This is consistent with our observation above that
$\H^1(G,\Z) = 0$. Using this vanishing and the right side of the 
exact sequence we obtain an isomorphism
$$
\H^1(G,\Z/m\Z) \isom \H^2(G,\Z)[m].
$$
As we observed above, when a group acts trivially the $\H^1$
is $\Hom$, so
\begin{equation}\label{eqn:h2}
  \H^2(G,\Z)[m] \isom \Hom(G,\Z/m\Z).
\end{equation}
One can prove that for any $n>0$ and any module~$A$ that the group
$\H^n(G,A)$ has exponent dividing $\#G$ (see Remark~\ref{rmk:cores}).  
Thus (\ref{eqn:h2}) allows
us to understand $\H^2(G,\Z)$, and this comprehension arose
naturally from the properties that determine $\H^n$.



\section{Inflation and Restriction}
Suppose $H$ is a subgroup of a finite group~$G$ and $A$
is a $G$-module.  For each~$n\geq 0$, there is a natural map
$$
  \res_H : \H^n(G,A) \to \H^n(H,A)
$$
called restriction.  Elements of $\H^n(G,A)$ can be viewed as classes
of $n$-cocycles, which are certain maps $G \times \cdots \times G \to
A$, and the restriction maps  restricts these cocycles to $H
\times \cdots \times H$.  

If~$H$ is a normal subgroup of~$G$, there is also an inflation map
$$
\inf_H: \H^n(G/H, A^H) \to \H^n(G,A),
$$
given by taking a cocycle $f : G/H \times \cdots \times G/H \to A^H$
and precomposing with the quotient map $G\to G/H$ to obtain a cocycle for $G$.

\begin{proposition}\label{prop:infres}
Suppose $H$ is a normal subgroup of~$G$.
Then there is an exact sequence
$$
  0 \to \H^1(G/H, A^H)\xra{\inf_H}  \H^1(G,A)\xra{\res_H} \H^1(H,A).
$$
\end{proposition}
\begin{proof}
Our proof follows \cite[pg.~117]{serre:localfields} closely.

We see that $\res\circ \inf = 0$ by looking at cochains.  It remains
to prove that $\inf_H$ is injective and that the image of $\inf_H$
is the kernel of $\res_H$.
\begin{enumerate}

\item {\em That $\inf_H$ is injective:} Suppose $f:G/H\to A^H$ is a
  cocycle whose image in $\H^1(G,A)$ is equivalent to~$0$ modulo
  coboundaries.  Then there is an~$a\in A$ such that $f(\sigma) =
  \sigma a - a$, where we identify~$f$ with the map $G\to A$ that is
  constant on the costs of~$H$.  But $f$ depends only on the costs of
  $\sigma$ modulo~$H$, so $\sigma a - a = \sigma \tau a - a$ for all
  $\tau \in H$, i.e., $\tau a = a$ (as we see by adding $a$ to both
  sides and multiplying by $\sigma^{-1}$).Thus $a\in A^H$, so $f$ is
  equivalent to~$0$ in $\H^1(H,A^H)$.

\item {\em The image of $\inf_H$ contains the kernel of $\res_H$:}
Suppose $f:G\to A$ is a cocycle whose
restriction to $H$ is a coboundary, i.e., there is $a\in A$ such
that $f(\tau) = \tau a - a$ for all $\tau \in H$. 
Subtracting the coboundary $g(\sigma) = \sigma a - a$ for $\sigma\in G$ 
from~$f$, we may assume $f(\tau) = 0$ for all $\tau \in H$.
Examing the equation $f(\sigma\tau) = f(\sigma) + \sigma f(\tau)$ 
with $\tau\in H$ shows that $f$ is constant on the cosets of~$H$.
Again using this formula, but with $\sigma\in H$ and $\tau\in G$, we see
that 
$$
  f(\tau) = f(\sigma \tau) = f(\sigma) + \sigma f(\tau) = \sigma f(\tau),
$$
so the image of~$f$ is contained in $A^H$.  Thus $f$ defines a cocycle
$G/H \to A^H$, i.e., is in the image of $\inf_H$.
\end{enumerate}

\end{proof}

This proposition will be useful when proving
the weak Mordell-Weil theorem.

\begin{example}
The sequence of Proposition~\ref{prop:infres} need not be
surjective on the right.  For example, suppose $H=A_3 \subset S_3$,
and let $S_3$ act trivially on the cyclic group $C = \Z/3\Z$.
Using the $\Hom$ interpretation of $\H^1$, we see
that 
$\H^1(S_3/A_3, C) = \H^1(S_3, C) = 0$, but 
$\H^1(A_3, C)$ has order~$3$.
\end{example}


\begin{remark}
On generalization of Proposition~\ref{prop:infres} is to
a more complicated exact sequence involving the ``transgression map'' 
tr:
$$
  0 \to \H^1(G/H, A^H)\xra{\inf_H} \H^1(G,A)\xra{\res_H} \H^1(H,A)^{G/H}
\xra{{\rm tr}}  \H^2(G/H,A^H) \to \H^2(G,A).
$$
Another generalization of Proposition~\ref{prop:infres}
is that if $\H^m(H,A) = 0$ for $1\leq m < n$, then
there is an exact sequence
$$ 
 0 \to \H^n(G/H, A^H)\xra{\inf_H}  \H^n(G,A)\xra{\res_H} \H^n(H,A).
$$
\end{remark}

\begin{remark}\label{rmk:cores}
  If $H$ is a not-necessarily-normal subgroup of~$G$, there are also
  maps
$$
 \cores_H: \H^n(H,A) \to \H^n(G,A)
$$
for each~$n$.  For $n=0$ this is the trace map $a\mapsto \sum_{\sigma
  \in G/H} \sigma a$, but the definition for $n\geq 1$ is more involved.
One has $\cores_H \circ \res_H = [\#(G/H)]$. 
Taking $H=1$ we see 
that for each $n\geq 1$ the group
$\H^n(G,A)$ is annihilated by $\#G$. 
\end{remark}

\section{Galois Cohomology}
Suppose $L/K$ is a finite Galois extension of 
fields, and $A$ is a module for $\Gal(L/K)$.
Put
$$
 \H^n(L/K, A) = \H^n(\Gal(L/K), A).
$$

Next suppose~$A$ is a module for the group $\Gal(K^{\sep}/K)$
and for any extension~$L$ of~$K$, let
$$A(L) = \{x \in A : \sigma(x) = x \text{ all } \sigma \in\Gal(K^{\sep}/L)\}.$$
We think of $A(L)$ as the group of elements of~$A$ that are
``defined over~$L$''.  
For each~$n\geq 0$, put
 $$ 
  \H^n(L/K, A) = \H^n(\Gal(L/K), A(L)).
$$
Also, put
$$
 \H^n(K,A) = \varinjlim_{L/K} \H^n(L/K,A(L)),
$$
where $L$ varies over all finite Galois extensions of $K$.
(Recall: Galois means normal and separable.)
%(There's much hidden in that direct limit.)

\begin{example}
The following are examples of $\Gal(\Qbar/\Q)$-modules:
$$
  \Qbar,\quad \Qbar^*,\quad \Zbar,\quad\Zbar^*,\quad E(\Qbar),\quad
 E(\Qbar)[n], \quad {\rm Tate}_{\ell}(E),
$$
where $E$ is an elliptic curve over~$\Q$.
\end{example}

\begin{theorem}[Hilbert 90]\label{thm:h90}
We have $\H^1(K,\Kbar^*) = 0$.
\end{theorem}
\begin{proof}
See \cite{serre:localfields}.  The main input to the proof is linear
independence of automorphism and a clever little calculation.
%It suffices to prove for every finite Galois extension
%$L/K$ that $\H^1(L/K,L^*) = 0$.  ... (copy from Serre.)
\end{proof}
