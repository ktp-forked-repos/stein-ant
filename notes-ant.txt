* define ideal after defining ring and module.

* after defn 4.1.2 (noetherian) should say that M is noetherian.

* in proof of prop 4.1.4 1=>2, should have Moo instead of M in
a few places.

* say what "maximal" means (i.e., nothing is > it).

* otherwise "M1 would be maximal"

* in lemma 4.1.7, note that it's an exact sequence of R-modules,
  where S gets an R-module structure from phi.

* in proof of hilbert basis:   
    - define "leading coefficient":
           coefficient of highest degree term, e.g., 
              3x^7 + 5x^2  - 4 has leading coefficient 3.
    - if a,b in I with a+b =/= 0 ... reads confusingly, since condition
      that a+b=/= 0 is not required.
    - make the a_i that generate I nonzero.
    - "and the a_j are in I" should be "... in A", no?
    - "The module S<d is submodule"  (missing article)
    - "The S<d is a finitely generated R-module"
    - "Suppose g in I is arbitrary".  Rephrase this whole induction, which
      is done in a REALLY BAD way at present.  Just prove by induction
      that every g in I is a combination of fi's and gi's.  Induct on 
      the degree of an element.  Do base case -- degree 0.  Then do
      general case --- given g of degree n, suppose know statement for
      all elements of I of degree < n, by degree < d and >= d.
      Degree 0:  without loss, chose the d above to be >= 1.

* chapter on rings of integers: 
    - Qbar "could be the subfield ..." --> one model of Qbar is...
    - "much of this course" --> "... book"

* in defn of min poly require degree is positive.

* give examples right after defn of algebraic number, and min poly.

* "however, f is the poly of least deg" ; use that poly is monic.

* exercise -- use that Q[x] is a pid to show that min poly is uniq.
